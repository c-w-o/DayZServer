## Usage

### Docker CLI

```s
    docker create \
        --name=arma-server \
        -p 2302:2302/udp \
        -p 2303:2303/udp \
        -p 2304:2304/udp \
        -p 2305:2305/udp \
        -p 2306:2306/udp \
        -v arma3/server-0:/var/run/share/arma3/this-server \
        -v arma3/server-common:/var/run/share/arma3/server-common \
        -e ARMA_CONFIG=server.cfg \
        -e BASIC_CONFIG=basic.cfg \
        -e STEAM_USER=myusername \
        -e STEAM_PASSWORD=mypassword \
        ghcr.io/brettmayson/arma3server/arma3server:latest
```

### docker-compose

Use the docker-compose.yml file inside a folder. It will automatically create 4 folders in which the missions, configs, mods and servermods can be loaded.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`, containing at least `STEAM_USER` and `STEAM_PASSWORD`.

Use `docker-compose start` to start the server.

Use `docker-compose logs` to see server logs.

Use `docker-compose down` to shutdown the server.

The `network_mode: host` can be changed to explicit ports if needed.

Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the server, detached.

See [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) for an installation guide.

Profiles are saved in `/arma3/configs/profiles`

### Example

`-e ARMA_CDLC="csla;gm;vn;ws;spe"`

## Loading mods
A mods.html shoud be provided (e.g. exported form the Arma3 Launcher) which includes all client-side mods, the server should also use. 

### Per-Server
-> those are only available for this server instance and will be loaded in any case. These mods also have precedence over mods from global directory.

1. Place the mods in `server-x/mods` or `server-x/servermods`.
2. Be sure that the mod folder is all lowercase and does not show up with quotation marks around it when listing the directory eg `'@ACE(v2)'`. Make also sure to replace `:` by `_` and that the addon folders inside the mod folder is all lowercase. Also all .pbo and .paa files have to lowercase.
3. TODO: provide script to force those rules of (2).
4. Make sure that each mod contains a lowercase `/addons` folder. This folder also needs to be lowercase in order for the server to load the required PBO files inside.
5. Start the server.

### Global Mods
-> those mods are shared among all server instances and the include folder shold be mounted read-only.

1. Place the mods in `server-common/mods` and DLCs in `server-common/dlcs`.
2. Same naming rules and conventions apply as for Per-Server mods.


Set the environment variable `MODS_PRESET` to the HTML preset file exported from the Arma 3 Launcher. The path can be local file or a URL. A volume can be created at `/arma3/steamapps/workshop/content/107410` to preserve the mods between containers.

`-e MODS_PRESET="my_mods.html"`
